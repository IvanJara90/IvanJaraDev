### Our Website's Progress

- **Description**: I am learning to build and deploy this personal portfolio website with the help of Google's Gemini. The site is built with Hugo and the PaperMod theme, and the process has been supported by the official documentation from Hugo and the theme's GitHub repository. This project showcases the process of setting up a static site, customizing it, and deploying it with GitHub Pages.
