![Ivan's Profile Picture](/images/profile.jpg){.ivan-jara}

Hello! I'm Ivan, a tech enthusiast with a background in recruitment and a passion for building things with code.

My journey into the world of technology started with a curiosity for how things work, which led me to explore everything from hardware repair to web development. I'm currently diving deep into data analytics and honing my skills in Python, with the goal of building a career in software development.

This website is my digital space to document my projects, share what I'm learning, and connect with others who are passionate about technology.

When I'm not at my computer, you can find me exploring the vibrant city of Bogot√°, Colombia, or planning my next travel adventure.

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-jara-recruter/) or check out my full [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i6n3s3gKkZDXExv419oyAgktPoNpgubb/view?usp=sharing).
